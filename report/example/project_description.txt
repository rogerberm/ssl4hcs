Project description
When dealing with unannotated or partially annotated proteomes, protein identification is often carried out by searching a database containing protein sequences from other species. Identification of a
protein from a different species is often assumed as enough evidence to claim that this protein was identified in a protein sample. This work attempts to systematically evaluate at what extent this holds true,
by comparing search results of unannotated proteins extracted from the Cassava (Manihot esculenta)
root against different annotated databases, including the reference species Arabidopsis thaliana, the
Viridiplantae database (containing a large number of green plants), and the annotated proteome of
Cassava itself.
