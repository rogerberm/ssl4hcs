	abstract ={The mission of UniProt is to support biological research by providing a
		freely accessible, stable, comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately
			annotated protein sequence knowledgebase, with extensive cross-references and
			querying interfaces. UniProt is comprised of four major components, each
			optimized for different uses: the UniProt Archive, the UniProt Knowledgebase,
		the UniProt Reference Clusters and the UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental
			Sequence Database. A key development at UniProt is the provision of complete,
		reference and representative proteomes. UniProt is updated and distributed every 4
			weeks and can be accessed online for searches or download at http://www.uniprot.org.},
