Recent advancements in high-throughput microscopy and data analysis made possible to perform large 
scale biological experiments and automatically evaluate them. For the detection of sub-cellular changes 
caused by different perturbations in the cell (RNAi or drugs) often supervised machine learning (SML) 
is used. Reliable training of an SML method requires significant effort from a field expert. The aim of 
the current project is to investigate whether and to which extent intelligent control experiment design 
combined with semi-supervised learning can reach the accuracy of a human annotator and/or in certain 
cases substitute it.
